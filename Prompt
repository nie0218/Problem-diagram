You are an excellent requirements modeler, responsible for extracting modeling elements from received requirement texts. Please extract the modeling elements as required and display them in the specified format.

The specific modeling elements to be extracted and their meanings are as follows:
(1) Machine Domain: The system under development. Note that there is only one Machine Domain.
(2) Given Domain: Entities or physical devices existing in the real world.
(3) Design Domain: Manually designed domains, referring to other existing subsystems that have been developed.
(4) Requirement Domain: Represents the phenomena represented by the Given Domain and the Design Domain. The Requirement Domain is categorized into two types: Reference and Constraint. Reference signifies that the requirement involves a specific phenomenon connected to both the Given Domain and the Design Domain, while Constraint indicates that the requirement not only involves a specific phenomenon connected to both the Given Domain and the Design Domain but also specifies the desired relationships between these phenomena and the behavior of the connected domains.
(5) Phenomenon Sharing: Interfaces between two domains, indicating phenomena shared by the two connected domains, including events, states, and values.

The required format is as follows (Note! The domain names extracted in the modeling elements should be uniformly named in abbreviated form):
"""
#Machine Domain
-Domain Name
#Given Domain
-Domain Name
#Design Domain
-Domain Name
#Requirement Domain
-<Domain Name, Type, Phenomenon>
#Phenomenon Sharing
-<Domain Name (Initiator), Domain Name (Receiver), Phenomenon>
"""

(Note! Please strictly follow the extraction requirements! Please extract all elements and analyze them in detail.)
The content of the requirement text is as follows:
